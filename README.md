***Design and Implementation of Auto- Adjustable Flame Control System***

To address the growing demand of smart kitchen appliance we came up with an innovative design to enhance precision, efficiency, and safety in gas stoves - The Auto-Adjustable Flame Control System. We designed and simulated the system using SolidWorks and ANSYS Workbench, ensuring robust mechanical design and precise performance analysis. Key features include:
- Automatically regulates flame intensity using real-time temperature data, minimizing the need for manual intervention.
- Infrared sensors, thermocouples, and servo motors work together to maintain consistent cooking temperatures.
- Users can set and lock their desired cooking temperature, with added safety features such as auto shut-off and timer-based cooking.
- Ergonomic Design: We focused on ease of use, accessibility, and maintenance.
This project combines my passion for Innovation, allowing me to apply and enhance my skills in CAD while providing a practical solution for consumers.
